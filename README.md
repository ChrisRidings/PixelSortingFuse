<p>This fuse helps you create pixel sorting effects in Davinci Resolve Fusion. </p>
<p>Download the file PixelSorting.fuse</p> (easiest way is to select the green "code" drop down menu on github, download ZIP, and copy the file from the zip)
<p>In Windows it's easiest to right click, save as and download and save the file to:</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Fuses</p>
<p>On a Mac you should find the Fuses folder under:</p>

<p>After downloading the file and saving it in the folder, you will need to restart Davinci Resolve if you already have it open. Otherwise it won't show.</p>
